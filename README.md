# Planets

The project consists of a Python program that simulates the dynamics of the solar system. Initally all the planets are aligned and their velocities are obtained from real world data. The time evolution of the system is obtained using the Verlet algorithm, which obtains the positions and velocities of the planets after a certain time step. Then, the information of each planet is stored in a .txt file. At the end of the process, the periods of the planets are shown in the terminal. <br />

In order to visualize the data, you can use the program "animation.py". By changing the value of 'limit' in the code, you can see dynamics of inner or outer planets. <br />
